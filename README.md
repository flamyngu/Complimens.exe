# Compliments.exe

A small, retro-style, one-page web app that gives you a compliment every time you press the button – with a custom cursor.

Try it out yourself here:  
[Try Compliments.exe](https://www.stanev.at/Compliments/compliments.html)  
No account, no sign-up – just click the button and get a compliment.

If you have ideas for new compliments, let me know! I’ll add them.  
The current ones still have room for improvement, so suggestions are very welcome.
